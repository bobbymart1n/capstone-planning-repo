# Capstone Planning
**A capstone planning repo for Epicodus 07.20.18**

## By Bobby Martin

## Description
This repo is used for the sole purpose of laying out my personal capstone project. My capstone project is a React Native application that uses the Whitepages PRO Phone Reputation API. It displays data about a phone number and whether or not that number is some sort of scam or marketing call. It then displays all reported numbers on a single comment board.
